However, before students could graduate from the school, the school decides to discriminate against risky students and push them out of the school. As a result, risky students are more likely to transfer out of the school. Even though we have randomized treatment, we could get a biased estimate of the causal effect of tutoring on graduation rates for the general school population as less risky students will be more represented in our sample.

In other words, $R$ is a common cause of $T$ and $G$. Another way to say that is $T$ and $G$ are **confounded** by $R$. So if there's a lot of people at-risk who receive treatment, then it is quite possible that there is a negative association between the treatment and outcome, *even though the treatment actually improves the outcomes for most/all individuals*."
